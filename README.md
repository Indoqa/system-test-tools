# Indoqa System Test Tools

This library contains a Junit infrastructure rule that spawns a separate Java process and destroys it after all tests have been run. It is useful to test single JAR applications which are the usual artefacts provided by [Indoqa Boot](https://github.com/Indoqa/indoqa-boot) or Spring Boot.
